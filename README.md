# Technology Stack

We tried to use a completely modern tech stack while testing out some new technologies that we had never used before. This resulted in a fast, performant, and easily-extensible web app that should be fairly future-proof for the coming next several years. We used:

* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
* [React-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)
* [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/sites/work-from-mountains/overview)
* [Sentry](https://sentry.io/)
* [contentful](https://www.contentful.com/)
